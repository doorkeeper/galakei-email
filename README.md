# Galakei::Email

Japanese carriers provide each mobile subscriber with an email address. The email works basically the same as normal email, but with some caveats. This gem takes care of transforming normal mail into galakei mail.

This functionality has been extracted from the [galakei](https://github.com/mobalean/galakei) gem.
